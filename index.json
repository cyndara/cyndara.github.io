    "body": "Headings Despite having cultivated a consistent habit of lifting heavy things and putting them down again at 3-4 times a week for the last 10 years the lockdown has completely changed everything! Disregarding the fact that I also moved to a neighbouring country and made some significant changes to my lifestyle I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to attend a gym since March 2020. It\u0026rsquo;s been difficult and i\u0026rsquo;ve definitely noticed a significant difference in my health.\nI moved into an old farmhouse in central Germany owned by my partner in August 2020. With plenty of space and spare rooms there were no reasons against building a home gym. It was always a personal dream and all I really needed was enough space for a squat rack, barbell and olympic weight plates!\nThe room we would turn into a gym room was called a \u0026ldquo;Sommerkueche\u0026rdquo; which was in a separate building on the property. It was initially filled with all sorts of rubbish like a Wurstkessel. Quite literally a huge metal or porcelain barrel/vessel for boiling sausages I believe. Really old ovens, window panes, furniture and super furry walls.\n  Gross wet wall     Sexy Tedi outfit which was thrown in the bin afterwards     Gross sink and old oven     Mouldy walls     Liquid gold     Asbestos     Clean walls?
